> **IMPORTANT â€” credentials.json (DUMMY DATA)**
>
> The `credentials.json` file included here contains **dummy placeholder values only** and must be **replaced** with your own OAuth credentials downloaded from Google Cloud Console.  
> **Do NOT** use the dummy values for production or real accounts â€” committing or sharing real credentials can cause serious security and billing issues.
